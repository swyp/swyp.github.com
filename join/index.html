</p><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Manufacturers have been creating silos of cooperability, in which devices can transfer content using novel methods like 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lye_cvYj8EU&amp;feature=player_embedded">Photo Stream</a> or 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lQwj5XDzN8&amp;feature=player_embedded">Android Beam</a>, but where outside devices collaborate using archaic methods like email.
The siloing that is happening across vendor boundaries will block innovation and competition in the long term. 
</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>Sw&yuml;p allows content transfer across any apps running on any devices, mediating content-type translation to provide seamless communication with a device-appropriate gesture. Here's 
<a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669697/it-exists-mit-creates-tech-for-moving-files-across-devices-with-a-swipe">one example</a>.
</p><h3>What we're doing</h3><p>We&apos;re promoting Sw&yuml;p as the standard for inter-device content transfer, designing new augmented reality techniques for transferring content, building display-free devices for physical-to-digital Sw&yuml;ps, putting interactive digital displays around campus, and implementing a permanent Sw&yuml;p installation at the Media Lab.
</p><h3>Who we are</h3><p>Graduate student/entrepreneur
<a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/people/natan/about/natan.html">Natan Linder</a> and undergrad 
<a href="http://listprojects.com">Alex List</a>, at the 
<a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/people/natan/current/swyp.html">MIT Media Lab</a>. 
<br>We're happy to work with the most talented and motivated individuals in the entire world. 
</p><h3>Who we&apos;re needing</h3><p><ol><li><a href="http://www.quora.com/What-makes-a-great-developer-evangelist">Great developer evangelists</a> interested in helping get Sw&yuml;p integrated in apps worldwide.
</li><li>People interested in massive federated web-frameworks, and capable of advancing the development of our heroku /nodejs/socket.io based web-app, <a href="http://swyp.us">swyp.us</a>, exposing APIs, and allowing for the addition of large numbers of simultaneous users. 
</li><li>People interested in improving the user-facing aspects of Sw&yuml;p, and capable of website interface development to promote more intuitive and reliable content transfer, and better <a href="http://swyp.us/out/">third-party website</a> integration. 
</li><li>People interested in making the physical world more digital, and capable of building discrete touch-enabled devices for swyp-outs from display-less surfaces. EG, for taking digital copies of physical posters or plaques. </li><li>People interested in 3D interfaces and augmented reality, and capable of writing vision software for developing Sw&yuml;p as a sort of 'right-click for the air.'
